    2017년부터 네이버 검색에서 근무하면서 SRE(Site Repliability Engineering) 플랫폼과 대용량 시계열 데이터베이스의 구축 및 운영을 담당하고 있습니다. 2명에서 시작된 작은 개발 팀을 맡아 9명이 될 때까지 약 2년 간 리딩한 경험이 있습니다. 이후 9개월의 육아 휴직 기간을 가졌고, 복귀한 뒤에는 팀의 리더가 아닌 개별 기여자(Individual Contributor)로서 또 열심히 역할을 다하고 있습니다. 네이버에서 근무하기 전에는 티맥스에서 데이터베이스를 개발하였습니다. 그리고 대학원에서 추천시스템을 연구한 경험도 있습니다. 
    
    특정 기술이나 도메인보다는 문제를 해결하는 일 자체에 관심이 많습니다. 소프트웨어와 데이터를 다루는 기술을 통해 일상 생활에서 발생하는 수많은 어려운 문제들을 조금이나마 쉽게 해결할 수 있다고 믿습니다.

    Including an interest section in your resume can be helpful if your interests are relevant to the job you are applying for, such as if you are applying for a job in a creative field and your hobbies include painting or writing. It can also be useful if you are applying for a job where teamwork or social skills are important, and you can mention interests that demonstrate those qualities.

    In this section, you can highlight your achievements, areas of expertise, and any unique qualities or experiences that set you apart from other candidates. You can also mention areas where you are looking to improve or gain further experience.

    A well-crafted self-evaluation section can demonstrate your self-awareness and confidence in your abilities, as well as your willingness to continuously learn and grow.

    A reference section in a resume is a list of individuals who can vouch for your skills, work ethic, and character. These individuals are typically former managers, colleagues, or mentors who have worked closely with you in the past and can provide insight into your abilities and work style.

    It's important to note that including a reference section in a resume is not always necessary, and some employers may prefer to request references separately. If you do choose to include a reference section, it should typically be located at the end of your resume.

    When listing references, be sure to include the individual's name, job title, company name, phone number, and email address. It's also a good idea to ask for the individual's permission before listing them as a reference, and to let them know what kind of job you are applying for so they can speak to your relevant skills and experience.

    It's important to choose references who can provide a positive and comprehensive evaluation of your work. Avoid listing family members or friends as references, and instead focus on individuals who can speak to your professional abilities and accomplishments.
